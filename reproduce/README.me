This folder allows you to reproduce the paper results, train icatcher on your own dataset, compare and measure performance and visualize results as well.


# Getting a local copy of the code

### Step 1: Clone the repository to get a copy of the code to run locally

`git clone https://github.com/yoterel/icatcher_plus.git`

### Step 2: Create a conda virtual environment

We recommend installing [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for this, then create an environment using the environment.yml file in this repository:

**Note**: conda must be in the PATH envrionment variable for the shell to find it.

Navigate to the icatcher_plus reproduce folder using the Anaconda Prompt:

`cd /path/to/icathcer_plus/reproduce`

Then:

`conda env create -n env -f environment.yml`

Or (if you want to install the environment in a specific location):

`conda env create --prefix /path/to/virtual/environment -f "/path/to/environment.yml"`

**Note for Mac users**: you might need to edit the [environment.yml](https://github.com/yoterel/icatcher_plus/blob/master/environment.yml) file depending on your OS version. see [here](https://github.com/yoterel/icatcher_plus/issues/6#issuecomment-1244125700) for how.

Activate the environment

`conda activate env`

### Step 3: Download the neural network model & weight files

iCatcher+ relies on some neural-network model files to work (or reproduce experiments).

Please download all files from [here](https://osf.io/ycju8/download) and place them in the reproduce/models directory.
